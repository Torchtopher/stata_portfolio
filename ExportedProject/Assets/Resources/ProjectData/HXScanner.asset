  projectName: Patient History Extraction
  detailedDescription: "This was my first big programming project. The goal was to take scanned
    handwritten patient history forms (from people who got a mammogram) and determine if
    they had a history of breast cancer and/or prior surgery. This data was important for training
    an AI to detect breast cancer.\n\nThe inputs are DICOM files which contain
    a PDF with the report embedded within. After converting to .png, I came up with an algorithm for this particular form. 
    There are 3 steps: first, the location of all the possible checkboxes are determined; second, we run OCR to find
    'Have you had breast cancer/surgery', and finally, look for a set of 4 boxes
    that are in line with the detected text. This works quite well and is highly specific
    (which was good because the company did not want any cancer/surgery patients in their dataset).
    It's also pretty resilient to variability in the scan itself (rotation/different
    sized forms).\n\nFun fact! I got a draft working in 2021, but never made it to production, 
    as the company tried to outsource the problem to a larger vendor. 
    However, they were unable to make it work - and so my final revision was purchased 
    and has since been used on over 10,000 patient forms. From what I understand
    the data is way too messy/inconsistent for the off-the-shelf OCR solution they tried. 
    It's also a neat project to see my development as a programmer. I will always remember my O(n^4) 
    quadruple nested loop from the first iteration and how far I have come since then."
