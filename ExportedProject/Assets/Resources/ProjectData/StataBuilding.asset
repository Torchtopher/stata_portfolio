  detailedDescription: "This is a 3D scan of the Stata Center at MIT, created initally
    in 2019 for use in the aera lab's project 'Flightgoggles', a photorealistic simiulator
    for testing drones. The environment (which was quite hard to find and get working)
    has been repurposed for WebGL and is now playable as a 'game' where you can view
    projects and find projects I made! I thought of this idea after touring/talking to members of their
    lab (thanks Andrea :)). The point was to imagine if my projects were in this
    building... oh wait. \n\nLarge rotating exclamation marks indicate posters you
    can interact with to learn more about each. See if you can find them all (they are not hidden)
    Also feel free to explore the building, I find it quite fun to read the exhibits/blackboards.
    The textures are all closeish to their native resolution so small text is often readable (I have even
    scanned a QR code in here on the desktop version).\n\nThe hardest challenge with this project was getting
    the envrioment set up and building/optimizing for web. You can read more above but I got the assets from
    a data.unity3d file that is now no longer avaiable for download. I got the project working with only a few
    things missing (most of the lighting/shadows I turned off as a tradeoff so the game runs better) and now you
    are playing it on the web!"
