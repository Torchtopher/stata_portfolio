  detailedDescription: "This is a 3D scan of the Stata Center at MIT, created initially
    in 2019 for use in the AERA lab's project 'Flightgoggles,' a photorealistic simulator
    for testing drones. I repurposed the environment for WebGL, so it is now playable as a 'game'
    where you can view some of my projects. I thought of this idea after touring/talking to members of their
    lab (thanks Andrea :)).\n\nLarge rotating exclamation marks indicate posters you
    can interact with and learn more about them. See if you can find them all!
    Also feel free to explore the building, I find it quite fun to read the exhibits/blackboards.
    The textures are all close to their native resolution, so small text is often readable (I have even
    scanned a QR code in here on the desktop version).\n\nThe hardest challenge with this project was getting
    the environment set up and building/optimizing for the web (you can read more in the page above). I got the project working with only a few
    things missing (I turned off most lighting/shadows so the game runs better). I hope you find it as cool as I do :)"
