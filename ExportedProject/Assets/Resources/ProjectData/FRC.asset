  projectName: 'FRC: Object detection, autonomous mode, and localization'
  detailedDescription: "In 2024, many of the project I had worked on finally came together to make a robot that could dynamically
    steal notes (game pieces) from the other team during the autonomous mode. One of the first things I worked on
    was object detection/tracking (see images to right). I trained
    our models (ssd_mobilenet and later YOLOv8) and also wrote CUDA code to vastly
    speed up our preprocessing step: it went from ~15fps detection (bottlenecked by resizing/color
    conversion) to 30fps. In the 2024 season, I implemented TagSLAM for localization. As a side note: it can
    do SLAM but for our use we mapped the tags first and used that map for the rest of competition. This allowed us
    to do path following and run more complicated autos. I also worked on
    the auto node which combined all of the above to path follow up until we got close to a note, then
    run PID to pick the note up, and transition back into path following. It was really cool because
    if a note was already taken, it would pick up the next closest one and go back to following the correct part of the path.
    \n\nIt did actually work really well in a match (see maker portfolio video), where we completely countered
    the other team's auto with our robot running to the midline and stealing all their notes."
