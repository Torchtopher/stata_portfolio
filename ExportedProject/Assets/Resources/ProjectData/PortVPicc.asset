  projectName: Optimal PICC Line Removal
  detailedDescription: While I was undergoing chemo, I had a PICC line (long IV to central vein) to
  receive IV medications. On one hand, you can't keep it forever, as at a certain point the risk of infection becomes too high. 
  However there is also some cost/risk associated with taking it out and placing a new one. I also was a regular patient to the ER, 
  and going with a PICC line already inserted meant instant IV access vs having to wait
  hours to get a normal IV. The essential question, was "when is the best time to replace/take out my PICC line?"
  \n\nI figured that since I had good data on infection rates/how often I went
  to the ER, if I assigned a "cost" to how bad each of the outcomes was, we could determine the best time to take out the PICC line. 
  When I wrote it, I had four more cycles of chemo to go (plus projected ER visits). The program compared all the possible combinations
  of line removals/placements (it was in the ~20s) and reported the associated "cost". 
  You could also vary the costs (example infection rate) and see how it changed the decision.\n\n
  Using costs I assigned, the program gave the optimal option as keeping my PICC line until the end of treatment. 
  I showed my doctor and we talked about it. We ended up following its advice and...
  no infection! It seems more obvious now that it was the best decision, but at the time it was super helpful to ground our
  decisions with some data. I found the approach quite comforting because it's hard to know what's best
  when dealing with low probability events, so actually showing differences in strategy A vs B was helpful. I think similar tools could be useful  
  in shared decision making.
