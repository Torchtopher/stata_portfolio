  projectName: Optimal PICC Line Removal
  detailedDescription: While I was undergoing chemo, I had a PICC line (long IV to central vein) to
  recieve IV medications (chemo). On one hand, you can't keep it forever, as at a certain point the risk of infection becomes too high. 
  However there is also some cost/risk associated with taking and placing a new one. I also was a regular paitent to the ER, 
  and going with a PICC line already inserted means instant IV access vs having to wait
  hours to get a normal IV and antibiotics. The essential question was "when is the best time to replace/take out my PICC line?".
  \n\nI figured that since I had good data on infection rates/how often I go
  to the ER, if I assign a "cost" to how bad each of the outcomes is, we could determine the best time to take out the PICC line. 
  At the time I wrote it, I had four more cycles of chemo to go (plus projected ER visits). The program compared all the possible combinations
  of line removals (it was in the ~20s) and reported the associated "cost". 
  You could also vary the costs, of for example infection, and see how it changed the decision.\n\n
  Using costs for I assigned, the program gave the optimal option as keeping the line until the end of treatment. 
  I showed my doctor and we talked about it. We ended up following its advice and...
  no infection! It seems more obvious now that is was the best decision, but at the time it was super helpful to ground our
  decisions with some data. I found the approach quite comforting in the sense that it's hard to mentally figure what's best
  when dealing with low probability events, so actually showing you gain regarding the chance of infection
  with strategy A vs B was helpful. I think similar tools could and should have a great place for 
  shared decision making in the medical world.
