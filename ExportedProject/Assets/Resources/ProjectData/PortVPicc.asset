  projectName: Optimal PICC Line Removal
  detailedDescription: While I was undergoing chemo, I had a PICC line (long IV to central vein) to well
  recieve chemo. Essentially the question was "when is the best time to replace/take out this line". You
  can't keep it forever, as at a certain point the risk of infection becomes too high. However there is also some
  cost/risk associated with taking and placing a new one, as the new one could have gotten infected during placement etc.
  I also was a regular paitent to the ER, and going with a PICC line already inserted means instant IV access vs having to wait
  potentially hours to get a normal IV and antibiotics.\n\nI figured that since their is good data on infection rates/how often I go
  to the ER, if you assign a "cost" to how bad each of the outcomes is, we could determine the best time to take it out. When it was placed,
  the idea was taking it out every time, which just due to inertia didn't happen and we had to evalute what to do for the remaining
  3 cycles. The program worked quite well and using costs for me personally it gave the option of never taking
  the line out as optimal. I showed my doctor and we talked about it and ended up following its advice and...
  no infection! It seems more obvious now that is was the best decision but at the time it was super helpful to ground our
  decisions with at least some data. I found the approach quite comforting in the sense that it's hard to mentally figure whats best
  when dealing with low probabilty events and so actually showing you gain %X chance of infection with strategy A vs B is helpful.
  I think simmilar tools could and should have a great place for shared decision making in the medical world.
