  detailedDescription: "MiniFRC is a 1/4 scale robotics competition. In 2023 we had various
    double-jointed arms and a claw/roller intake, depending on the version. For 2024
    we built a ground intake with fixed angle shooter. \n\nOur robot stack is pretty
    fun, we have the normal ESP32 with NoU2 (adds motor/servo control), but instead
    of running all our logic code on it, we run ROS on a laptop and used bluetooth/websockets
    to send commands/receive data. We've done some cool stuff with this setup. In
    2023, we used the motion planner MoveIt (which is used by the industrial 7dof
    arms) to plan movements for our arm, which was quite helpful to synchronize movements
    and plan around obstacles (mostly just the robot itself). We have a hardware interface
    that writes to the servos so it 'just worked' with the ROS MoveIt package. \n\nIn
    2024, we put Apriltags on the side of the robot and the actual competition field. We then
    used a ZED2i that could be placed anywhere outside the field and would detect
    the field Apriltags (known position) and the tags on the robot. This gave us localization
    using a ROS package: TagSLAM. So the process is camera -> laptop -> calculate
    position -> send motor commands. This was the first (and only, as far as I know) full field localization
    in MiniFRC, and also let us (at least in practice) run a 4 note autonomous routine. 
    \n\nIt's also a cool project in that a lot of the development was essentially
    trial for actual (full-size) FRC. We later incoperated MoveIt on the FRC
    robot, and TagSLAM has been our localization solution since 2024."
