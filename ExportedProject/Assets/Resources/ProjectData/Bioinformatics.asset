  detailedDescription: In the Holley Lab, I worked on determining the sites of interactions between RNA and snoRNAs using snoGloBe, a tool that uses machine learning to predict exactly where these interactions occur. In practice, however, snoGloBe is not very useful as it outputs millions of interactions, most of which are completely infeasible biochemically. To fix this, I wrote a program that used IntaRNA (which predicts the strength of the bond between two sequences) to filter the snoGloBe output, discarding all the low-energy interactions. Finally, my program makes a file viewable in the UCSC genome browser along with the IntaRNA "arts" for manual analysis (see images to right).\n\nI also reworked snoGloBe and my code to run on the Duke Computer Cluster (which uses SLURM), which was a linear speedup equal to the number of cores available (which was easily up to 10x faster than locally).\n\nMany lab members have benifted from the analysis pipeline and some of the predictions made have been proposed in grant applications! The lab is currently working on exploring and validating these predictions biologically.
