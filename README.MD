My projects inside the Stata center, playable on web.

See [cholley.net/mit](https://cholley.net/mit) for writeup and to play the game.

Actual assets to recreate game are .gitignored (project is over 60GB locally). Assets besides my own projects are from MIT [FlightGoggles](https://github.com/mit-aera/FlightGoggles), and publicly downloaded.


Relevent code for the game is at ```ExportedProject/Assets/Scripts``` as well just ```Scripts``` (before I had the Unity project). Project JSONs/images are in ```ExportedProject/Resources/*_textures``` and .assets
